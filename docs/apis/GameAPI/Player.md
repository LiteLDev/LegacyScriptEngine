## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Player Object API

In LLSE, use "player objects" to manipulate and obtain information about a player.

### Get a Player Object

#### Get From Event or API

By registering the **event listener** function, get the player object related to the related event given by BDS.
For details, see [Event listener documentation - EventAPI](/LLSEPluginDevelopment/EventAPI/Listen.md)

#### Acquired From Existing Players

Manually generate player objects by **player information**
Use this function to manually generate objects. Note that the player you want to get must be online, otherwise the generation will fail.

`mc.getPlayer(info)`

- Parameters: 
  - info : `String`  
    Player's name or XUID or uniqueId.
- Return value: The generated player object. 
- Return value type: `Player`
  - If the return value is `Null`, it means that getting the player failed.

#### Get All Online Players

This function returns an array of player objects, each of which corresponds to a player on the server.

`mc.getOnlinePlayers()`

- Return value: List of online `Player` objects.
- Return value type: `Array<Player,Player,...>`

> Note: Do not save a `Player` object **long-term**.
> When the player exits the server, the corresponding player object will become invalid. Therefore, if there is a need to operate a player for a long time, please obtain the real-time player object through the above methods.
